# `cmake-reconfig-rust`

Simple rust program to run cmake reconfiguration easily. 

## Why write something in Rust for C++???!!!11111oneoneonoene...

Because I can.

I like both languages, and I am not going to pick sides, because it's waste of time and brain-power to argue about
which language is good. 

I only care about languages how they feel and how fun it is to write in them and
if I can get some `satisfaction`.

## Usage

Use it as if you were using classic CMake, with a twist! Now it will reconfigure existing project by deleting 
`CMakeCache.txt` from target build folder (if none is provided it will default to current working directory)

## Information

Since I am learning rust, this is my first useful repo I am going to use myself, so feel free to inform me of any bugs
you might find.
